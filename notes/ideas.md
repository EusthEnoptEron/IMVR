# Ideas (unassorted)

- Use a different camera for selected image / not-selected image
    + Apply post-processing filters
- Use frequencies of BGM
- Use metadata of music & images
    + Show place of photographs on a globe (at the feet?)
    + ID3 tags with [the echo nest](http://echonest.com) to get relevant data
