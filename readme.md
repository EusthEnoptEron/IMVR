# IMVR

This project aims to create a tool that allows managing media files -- mainly pictures -- in a way that leverages the strengths of both the Leap Motion and the Oculus Rift.

## File Structure

- `dist`: distribution folder containing binaries
- `doc`: contains documentation
- `notes`: miscellaneous notes made during development
- `src`: contains the Unity source code

## Installing

- The AuxiliaryTools can be compiled without a problem on any modern computer that has .NET Framework 4 installed. (Indexer)
- The main application (made with Unity) is a bit trickier.
  - Unity 5 must be installed
  - The folders "Standard Assets", "ThirdParty" and "Plugins" are stored **outside this repository** and must be imported to keep the repository manageable.
